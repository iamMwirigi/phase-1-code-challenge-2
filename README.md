 ## Getting started

Welcome to the Flatacuties project, which is a demonstration of what I have learnt so far, using iteration of Arrays(looping), DOM manipulation, Communication with a server using the fetch API and json-server package.
Project setup

## To run this application:

    Clone the repository from https://github.com/iamMwirigi/phase-1-code-challenge-2
. If you see a 404, in the page when trying to clone, kindly ask me to add you to the repository as a contributor.
    Run npm install to install all necessary packages for the applction to work.

  ]
} 

    After everything is installed, run the command json-server -w db.json while in the project directory.
    Open the index.html file in the browser, and start interacting with the application

## How to use the application

    When you open the index.html file in the browser, you should see a list of animals. None is slected at first.

    Click on any animal name you want and you'll notice that that specific animals has been highlighted / shown below.

    At this point you can award points to the animal, and save the point you have awarded.

    The lowest point that can be awarded is zero and there is not upper limit i.e an animal can have as many points as they can amass.

    You are also able to reset a specific animal's points to zero, using a reset button that can be found at the bottom of each animal.
